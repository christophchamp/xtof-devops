On Ubuntu, it is really simple.

# adduser bob sudo

and you are done!

On CentOS, there are a couple more steps.

As root, run:

# /usr/sbin/usermod -aG wheel bob

then edit the /etc/sudoers file

# vi /etc/sudoers

change the following line from

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

to:

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

Once that is done, your user "bob" is part of the wheel group, who are allowed to use sudo.
