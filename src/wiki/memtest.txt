First find out memory site using free command.
$ free

Output:

 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        768304     555616     212688          0      22012     270996
-/+ buffers/cache:     262608     505696
Swap:       979956          0     979956

In above example my server has 768304K memory. Now use dd command as follows:
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=768304 of=/tmp/memtest count=1050
$ md5sum /tmp/memtest; md5sum /tmp/memtest; md5sum /tmp/memtest

According to him if the checksums do not match, you have faulty memory guaranteed. Read dd command man page to understand all options. dd will create /tmp/memtest file. It will cache data in memory by filling up all memory during read operation. Using md5sum command you are reading same data from memory (as it was cached).
